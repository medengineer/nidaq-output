## NI-DAQ Output

NI-DAQ Output enables analog and digital data acquired and generated by the Open Ephys GUI to be output via National Instruments (NI) devices. 

This plugin is currently a pre-release and has been developed using a PXIe-6341 card. Analog output on USB-based devices is not yet supported. Please open an issue if you have an NI device youâ€™d like to use that is not working as expected.

NIDAQ Output currently operates in immediate mode such that analog and digital data is output as soon as it is available without explicit synchronization.
